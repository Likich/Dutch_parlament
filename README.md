# üó≥Ô∏è Political Debate Topic Clustering & LLM Labeling

This project analyzes Dutch parliamentary debate transcripts using machine learning and language models to extract and label **topical themes** from LLM-generated codes. The workflow combines NLP preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, clustering, and LLM-driven topic labeling.

---

## üîç Project Goals

- Distinguish **topical codes** from procedural ones in debate data
- Visualize semantic structure using **PCA** on TF-IDF
- Automatically cluster similar codes using **KMeans**
- Label clusters using a **language model** (e.g., Mixtral or LLaMA3)
